# RedAcademy-HTML-CSS-Quiz
RedAcademy admissions test on HTML and CSS

Recreating a landing page based on a .jpg file. Basic HTML was supplied.

This was my first time using GitHub, so there was a lot to learn with the new technology. It was also the first time I used a CSS Reset stylesheet.

I edited all code in Visual Studio Code and tested changes with Chrome dev tools. Once I was satisfied with the edits, I made a GitHub commit and pushed them to an 'edits' branch of my Master file.

In an attempt to get accurate spacing and font sizing I downloaded a trial version of xScope and tried out the Ruler, Loupe and Overlay tools.

I also tried Chrome's PixelPerfect browser extension to overlay screenshots of the .jpg file on top of my working site. This was probably the most helpful way to find font-sizes and spacing.
